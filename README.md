# CucumberExample

This repo is created to show subjects below:

* **Selenium** library usage with Cucumber.
* 2 Scenarios which is defined below.


## How It Works

Use pom.xml file to get necessary dependencies.
I used intellij IDE for this project. 
If you want to use Intellij you should define test root folder and test resource folder in the IDE. 


## Scenarios

1. Adding a product to the cart by logging in
* User visits Hepsiburada.com site
* User login process is done
* The user will search for the product he wants to buy here.
* The user selects a product from the list of products displayed as a result of the Search (or a single result may also be returned).
* For the selected product, products from 2 different vendors are selected and added to the cart.

2. Adding the specified product to the cart without user login
* User visits Hepsiburada.com site
* The user selects a product from the spare parts of a drone from the Remote Control Cars tab under the category of Books, Music, Movies,Hobbies and adds it to the basket.
